A lot of complexity lies in inconsistent, unspoken assumptions in manual workflows

It's difficult to keep exactly what you want to build entirely in your head! it's hard to organize that information because there are different hierarchies.

### Code Highlighting

Here is a TypeScript function that greets you:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

const message = greet('world')
console.log(message)
```

You can also use `inline code` like this.
