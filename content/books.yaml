  description: Issei Suda is one of my favorite photographers. In this book, he captures scenes candid and surreal in late-1970s Shitamachi Tokyo, where he grew up. Kind of like an artsier version of Humans of New York, but back in the day.

  description: Photographers are highly secretive about the actual photos they take, preferring only to show you the final product. As such, I see Magnum Contact Sheets as a treasure trove of lessons from some of the best photographers in history.
